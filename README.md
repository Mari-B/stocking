# Stocking

This is my first Ruby on Rails app and it's a stock market app!

To create it I've followed [John Elder's course on Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/share/103uPy3@I26XH3TN4B2UvPguz6gOWi10n-pm4lYqgUZG6DKR-mtSvwxgUGTJktd2L_gE3AsqHQ==/).

It's deployed using Heroku + following [this documentation](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/sqlite3) instead of what's explained in the course.

Here's the [app link](https://boiling-beach-90415.herokuapp.com/).
